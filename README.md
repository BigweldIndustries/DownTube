# A simple GUI wrapper for yt-dlp that allows you to easily archive youtube channels

## Who is this for?
I am sure you are at least somewhat familiar with the idea of internet archivists, or people who archive content in case of a takedown or some other reason. This tool is for people who want to back up their favorite channels, but do not know how to program or use complicated command line tools

## How to install?
First install [python](https://python.org/downloads)

Then: 
1. Download the folder from this page
2. Extract it
3. If you are on windows, hold shift and right click in the empty space in the folder
4. Select "Open PowerShell Here"
5. It should open a terminal, simply enter ``py -m pip install -r requirements.txt``
6. Double click main.py

If you are not on windows, instructions are the same. You linux users all know how to open a terminal.

## Tips
This uses yt-dlp, so if you are archiving more than 5 channels at a time, this may cause throttling. I will fix this in a future update by queing channels 5 at a time.
